<!-- Hi, I’m Ian Burress — a mechanical engineer with a passion for solving complex problems through innovative design, hands-on testing, and cross-functional collaboration. I hold a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University and a Bachelor’s from Michigan State University, where I also competed as an NCAA wrestler and led the Solar Car Racing Team as Senior Business Director.

My professional journey has taken me through a series of rotational roles at Caterpillar, where I’ve worked on everything from warranty investigations and failure analysis to field validation and new product introductions. I’ve had the opportunity to support global customers in marine, locomotive, oil and gas, and electric power industries, and I’ve led initiatives that improved product reliability and saved significant costs.

I’ve also interned at Stellantis, Harley-Davidson, and Fiat Chrysler, where I contributed to quality improvements, design innovation, and manufacturing efficiency. My technical toolkit includes CAD platforms like SolidWorks, Siemens NX, and Creo, as well as simulation tools like Ansys and STAR-CCM+. I’m also proficient in Python, MATLAB, and Excel VBA.

Beyond engineering, I’m deeply committed to mentorship and sustainability. I’ve guided over 350 students across multiple universities and earned recognition such as the Texas A&M Campus Sustainability Champion and awards in solar car competitions.

Whether I’m in the lab, on the shop floor, or collaborating with global teams, I bring curiosity, grit, and a drive to make a meaningful impact.-->
