        <h2 class="pageTitle">Hi, I'm Ian Burress</h2>
        <p class="pageText">
          I am a Michigan State and Texas A&M grad working full time at Caterpillar as part of their Engineering Rotational Development Program. My day to day work varies but is centered around the Large Power Systems Division working on C175, 3500, 3600 series engines mainly focused in the Oil and Gas and Electric Power divisions.
        </p>
        <p class="pageText">
          My passion for the automotive industry began very early in my life, I learned colors and numbers by going to the local NASCAR track and from then on I was hooked. I always wanted to learn how things work and would tear everything apart and try to put it back together. This passion grew then to me fixing up motorcycles in high school and growing up just outside of NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia meant that there was no shortage of S.T.E.M. programs to get involved in. As a former Division 1 athlete and first generation college graduate, I tend to thrive in high pace high demand environments.
        </p>
        <p class="pageText">
          While at Michigan State in undergrad, my free time was either spent in study hall, in the wrestling room competing for their D1 program or in the solar car garage working on the chassis or website. Once I got to Texas A&M while I did not continue wrestling I did continue solar car, the only problem was there was no team. So I started a team and became the project manager of the team, forcing me to understand a lot of vehicle concepts very quickly and navigate and create a competitive vehicle. All of this while completing a masters thesis in the Non-Equilibrium Plasma Laboratory at Texas A&M. So for someone who was used to being so busy for so long I now try to enjoy my free time with various hobbies such as flying FPV drones, iRacing, martial arts (judo, jujitsu, striking, cage sparring), fitness, and motorsports! Most weekends you can find me at the track with a fire extinguisher in hand or in the gym training.
        </p>
        <p class="pageText">
          My background is very heavily influenced by the automotive industry. I have interned at companies like Harley Davidson and Stellantis twice, before eventually coming to Caterpillar and interning several times. In those internships I played various roles such as quality engineering, production engineering, components engineer, and interior design engineer. While each role taught me something new I eventually settled on becoming an applications engineer. While my role is constantly developing I think I can use my well rounded skill set to work with the various Cat teams to make sure we are producing the best unit we can for our customer (very similar to my experience running a solar car team). My career interests continue to expand and evolve and I expect to learn more as my engineering career continues but I think my passion is in testing, simulation, and validation. Seeing a concept through its iterations come to life is incredibly satisfying.
        </p>
        <p class="pageText">
          While at Michigan State I was a webmaster for the solar car team, this is my first time creating a website from scratch using HTML instead of a UI like wordpress. I hope to continue to evolve this website as I grow.
